## # 🍕🍔🍝Food Delivery App  
This project is a full-stack food ordering and delivery system that connects customers, restaurants, and delivery partners on a single platform. Customers can explore restaurant menus, add items to their cart, place secure orders, and track delivery status. The backend ensures reliable order processing and authentication, while the frontend delivers a responsive, user-friendly interface. Designed with scalability in mind, this app can be extended to support advanced features like loyalty programs, offers, and multi-location restaurants.
